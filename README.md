# Rust Natvis

Generates a more informative summary for `enum`'s when debugging Rust code in Windows. This requires using a debugger that uses Natvis files, for example WinDbg 
(doesn't work with LLDB for example).

## How to Use

Copy the [intrinsic.natvis](intrinsic.natvis) file to the `\Users\<user name>\.rustup\toolchains\stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib\rustlib\etc\` folder, replacing the original file, 
and then re-build your project in debug mode.

## In VS Code

1. Install [the MS C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) in VS Code.
2. Change the setting `rust-analyzer.debug.engine` to `ms-vscode.cpptools`.
3. Optionally copy the [launch.json](.vscode/launch.json) to the `.vscode\` folder in your Rust project, modify it to fit your project and then launch the VS Code debugger.

## Why not use LLDB on Windows?

When you use the default `*pc-windows-msvc` Rust Windows target, debug information will be written into PDB files (the `.pdb` files stored next to the debug executables).
This is the native debug format for MS Windows debuggers (WinDbg, Visual Studio etc.). LLDB only has limited supports for reading this format. For example,
if you print Rust `enum` values in any LLDB debugger in Windows (CodeLLDB in VS Code, JetBrain's RustRover etc.), it will show all enum variant values as children together with the `tag` child. 
There is simply not enough information to determine which `enum` variant is actually used, and the `tag` value can be really hard to decode. The PDB file on the other hand contains 
all the required information, even for complicated niche encodings (generated by [this compiler source code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_codegen_llvm/src/debuginfo/metadata/enums/cpp_like.rs)), so that's why [the Natvis pretty printers}(https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/etc/natvis) can provide better display of `enum` values.
